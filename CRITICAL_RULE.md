# CRITICAL RULE: Always Update memory.md

## **MANDATORY PRACTICE**
I must **ALWAYS** update memory.md with all important decisions, progress, and learnings during each session.

## **What to Document:**
1. **All major decisions** made and their rationale
2. **Technical solutions** implemented  
3. **Status** of each component/task
4. **Lessons learned** for future reference
5. **New commands** or configurations added
6. **Space usage** and resource management decisions
7. **Interactive command flags** discovered

## **When to Update:**
- **Continuously** throughout the session
- **After each major task** completion
- **When making important decisions**
- **When learning new technical solutions**
- **NOT just at the end** of the session

## **Why This Matters:**
- User has **explicitly reminded me multiple times**
- memory.md serves as **comprehensive reference** for all work
- Provides **complete context** for future work or replication
- Documents **decision rationale** for future reference
- Tracks **progress and status** of all components

## **User Feedback:**
- "have you been updating memory.md?"
- "remember your rule to always run commands in non-interactive mode. You should add mkfs.ext4 to the list of commands"
- Multiple reminders about documenting decisions and progress

## **CONSEQUENCE OF NOT FOLLOWING:**
- User will notice and remind me
- Important context may be lost
- Future work may be inefficient
- Decisions may be forgotten

**THIS IS A CRITICAL RULE THAT MUST BE FOLLOWED WITHOUT EXCEPTION**
